.SH NAME
tines_hnb \- hnb/Tines outliner format
.SH DESCRIPTION
The default file format for \fIhnb\fP is a simple XML document type.
The Tines outliner supports it as a legacy format,
but future versions will use OPML as the default.
.LP
The top-level element is <tree>, which contains one or more <node> elements.
<node> elements in turn can contain <data> and other <node> elements.
.LP
Each <node> element can have three optional attributes:
.IP \[bu] 4
\fItype\fP is a text string describing the node type.
Currently, Tines supports only the "todo" type.
.IP \[bu] 4
.I done
is a text string that can take the values "yes" or "no".
It is used in conjunction with
.BR type= \[dq]todo\[dq]
to indicate whether the to-do entry is checked or not.
.IP \[bu] 4
.I expanded
.RI ( lhnb
extension, adopted by Tines):
A text string that can take the values "yes" or "no".
It is used to indicate the saved expansion state of nodes with children.
.LP
The DTD is embedded in each hnb file.
